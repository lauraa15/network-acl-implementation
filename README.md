# Standard ACL Network Security Implementation

A comprehensive network security project demonstrating the implementation of Access Control Lists (ACLs) for subnet-based traffic filtering and network segmentation.

> **Academic Project**: This project was developed as part of **Task 2 Week 1** for the **IDN Cybersecurity Bootcamp** program.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project showcases the implementation of Standard Access Control Lists (ACLs) on a segmented network to enhance security through controlled access between different network subnets. The primary focus is on preventing unauthorized access to critical server infrastructure while maintaining legitimate network communication.

## üèóÔ∏è Network Architecture

### Topology Design
The network consists of three strategically segmented networks:

- **PC Network**: `192.168.10.0/24` - General user workstations
- **Laptop Network**: `192.168.20.0/28` - Trusted mobile devices  
- **Server Network**: `10.10.10.0/29` - Critical infrastructure servers

All segments are interconnected through a central router with proper interface configurations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Restrict Access**: Block traffic from PC network (`192.168.10.0/24`) to server network
- **Maintain Trust**: Allow legitimate access from Laptop network (`192.168.20.0/28`) to servers
- **Preserve Functionality**: Keep all other network communications operational

### Security Benefits
- Enhanced network segmentation
- Reduced attack surface
- Controlled access to critical resources
- Prevention of lateral movement in case of compromise

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### ACL Configuration
```cisco
Router(config)# access-list 1 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
Router(config)# access-list 1 permit any
Router(config)# interface FastEthernet6/0
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 1 in
```

### Technical Approach
- **Standard ACL**: Source IP-based filtering for efficient processing
- **Strategic Placement**: Applied closest to destination (server interface)
- **Inbound Direction**: Filtering incoming traffic to protected resources

## üìä Verification Results

### Access Control Validation
- ‚úÖ **PC Network ‚Üí Server**: Successfully blocked (2 matches recorded)
- ‚úÖ **Laptop Network ‚Üí Server**: Access permitted (59 matches recorded)
- ‚úÖ **Other Communications**: Maintained functionality

### Testing Methodology
- Connectivity tests from trusted Laptop network: **Successful**
- Connectivity tests from restricted PC network: **Blocked as intended**
- Internet and inter-router communication: **Fully functional**
